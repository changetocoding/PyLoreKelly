HW: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1110 Lesson 1, 2 & 3 (Why Python, Data Types & Operators, Data Structures. Apx 6 hours)

## Lesson 3: Revision of what we've learned

HW https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1110 Lesson 4
( Covers Dictionaries, if, for, while loops, enumerate, zip)

HW Fizz Buzz -Fun drinking game and teaching tool for division for kids.  
Count from 1 to 100. For each number output "This is X out of 100"  
Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 3 and 5 become fizz buzz.

Sample output:
> This is 1 out of 100  
> This is 2 out of 100  
> Fizz  
> This is 4 out of 100  
> Buzz  
> Fizz  
> This is 7 out of 100  
> ...

## Lesson 8: Modules, importing libaries and revision of objects
Modules. We will cover modules and importing other python files.  
We will then cover external libaries and how to import them. Creating a webserver with bottle will be used as a demonstration
[Modules](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Modules_and_Packages) 
[Offical Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)


HW: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1110 - Lesson 6 Scripting (Sections 22 to end)

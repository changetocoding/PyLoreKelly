# Semester 3

# Course content (5 weeks):
- Project Budget
- Hong and Emmanuel will give a lesson on functions next week.
- Unit testing
- Iterators, Generators and List comprehension

We will also start commiting homework in to this repository. This is to teach about collaborating using the same repository.  

Next semester will we start the data science stuff.  

# Project
## Budget tracker
There are three parts to it. Hopefully have enough time to two parts. It can be done as a group or individual project.

The goal of this is to build your first project using the skills you have. This will also be a stepping stone as in the next semester we will rewrite this, but using pythons data science libraries that will make it so much more easier and allow us to do more indepth analysis (and forecasting)

### Part I: Console input budget tracker:
In this part we create a python script where a user can enter thier expenditure. They can then ask questions of our application, like how much they are spending on each category

Enter money for the month  
Enter name, cost, category.  

User can query using any of these questions  
"Report?": list total spent on each category  
"How much money do I have?" Returns money left  
Predict my spend on category next month  (optional)  

You can also add additional questions that your program can answer



### Part II: Reading bank statement [Csv]
Getting users to type in thier expenditure is a bit long. In this part we will use the file reading skills we learnt to automatically read from a bank statement to populate our budget tracker
  

I've uploaded my bank statements from when I was travelling. Process that and answer the additional questions:  
- "Did I spend more money on items less than £20 or items more than £20?" Returns Yes/No   
- "What was the most expensive item I paid for (aka highest expenditure)?"
- "I had a budget of £2000. Was I over or below budget".
- "I was travelling for 50 days. What was my average spend per a day while traveling?"

Or you can also download a csv of you bank statement and run that through and answer some questions about your spend.

Note some items are income and should be ignored


The user inputting items is optional now

As an extension can write stuff user inputted to file too


### Part III: Scrape website (Will skip)
In this step we will scrape from a html page the budget information. We may skip this bit and cover webscraping in another semester.

# Anaconda, Virtual Environments
Anaconda is used by data scientist. It has some tools to make life easier and comes bundled with most of the data science libraries you will need.

Virtual environments is python copied to a different location and that python is used to run a script/project. This is useful because it allows the use of different versions of python on different projects.

We will run through installing it.

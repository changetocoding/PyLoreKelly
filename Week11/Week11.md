# Semester 2

# Course content (5 weeks):
- Project Budget
- Unit testing
- Iterators, Generators and List comprehension
We will also start commiting homework in to this repository. This is to teach about collaborating using the same repository.  
Next semester will we start the data science stuff.  

# Project
## Budget tracker
There are two parts to it. Hopefully have enough time to both parts

### Part I: Console input budget tracker:
In this part we create a python script where a user can enter thier expenditure. They can then ask questions of our application, like how much they are spending on each category

Enter money for the month  
Enter name, cost, category.  

User can query using any of these questions
"Report?": list total spent on each category
"Am I penny foolish or pound foolish?" Returns Yes/No
"How much money do I have?" Returns money left

### Part II: Reading bank statement [Csv]
Getting users to type in thier expenditure is a bit long. In this part we will use the file reading skills we learnt to automatically read from a bank statement to populate our budget tracker

You can read from your own bank statements and let us know how much you spend on each category, and if your are penny foolish or pound foolish. (! Do not commit your bank statement !)

### Part III: Scrape website

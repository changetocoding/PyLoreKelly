# Semester 3

# Course content (5 weeks):
- Project Budget
- Hong and Emmanuel will give a lesson on functions next week.
- Unit testing
- Iterators, Generators and List comprehension

We will also start commiting homework in to this repository. This is to teach about collaborating using the same repository.  

Next semester will we start the data science stuff.  

# Project
## Budget tracker
There are three parts to it. Hopefully have enough time to two parts. It can be done as a group or individual project.

The goal of this is to build your first project using the skills you have. This will also be a stepping stone as in the next semester we will rewrite this, but using pythons data science libraries that will make it so much more easier and allow us to do more indepth analysis (and forecasting)

### Part I: Console input budget tracker:
In this part we create a python script where a user can enter thier expenditure. They can then ask questions of our application, like how much they are spending on each category

Enter money for the month  
Enter name, cost, category.  

User can query using any of these questions  
"Report?": list total spent on each category  
"How much money do I have?" Returns money left  
Predict my spend on category next month  (optional)  

You can also add additional questions that your program can answer



### Part II: Reading bank statement [Csv]
Getting users to type in thier expenditure is a bit long. In this part we will use the file reading skills we learnt to automatically read from a bank statement to populate our budget tracker
  
Answer the additional questions:  
"Do you spend more money on items less than £10 or items nore than £10?" Returns Yes/No 
"What item did I spend the most money on?"

You can read from your own bank statements or mine and let us know how much you spend on each category, and if your are penny foolish or pound foolish. (! Do not commit your bank statement !)

### Part III: Scrape website (May skip)
In this step we will scrape from a html page the budget information. We may skip this bit and cover webscraping in another semester.

# Anaconda, Virtual Environments
Anaconda is used by data scientist. It has some tools to make life easier and comes bundled with most of the data science libraries you will need.

Virtual environments is python copied to a different location and that python is used to run a script/project. This is useful because it allows the use of different versions of python on different projects.

We will run through installing it.

# Things should know by now
- Load data into pandas and numpy
- Manipulate data using pandas & numpy
- Clean data using numpy (https://realpython.com/pandas-python-explore-dataset/#cleaning-data)


# Plotting
First off we need to import the plotting library
```python
%matplotlib
```
Or "%matplotlib inline" because it displays the plot in the Jupyter Notebooks itself, immediately below the cell that creates the plot:
```python
%matplotlib
```

The data we are working with

```python
import pandas as pd
download_url = (
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/"
    "data/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv"
)
df = pd.read_csv(download_url)
type(df)
```python

### Plotting median and percentiles
```python
df.plot(x="Rank", y=["P25th", "Median", "P75th"])
```
Note if not in jupyter noteback need to do this instead:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df.plot(x="Rank", y=["P25th", "Median", "P75th"])
plt.show()
```

## Different kind of plots
Can either pass a parameter to the kind argument or use one of below methods
```python
    .area()
    .bar()
    .barh()
    .box()
    .hexbin()
    .hist()
    .kde()
    .density()
    .line()
    .pie()
    .scatter()
```

## Plot a series as a histogram.
```python
median_column = df["Median"]
type(median_column)  # pandas.core.series.Series
# median_column.plot(kind="hist")
```

This is also very useful for identifying outlies

### Investigate outlier:
We'll sort and then plot top 5
```python
top_5 = df.sort_values(by="Median", ascending=False).head()
top_5.plot(x="Major", y="Median", kind="bar", rot=5, fontsize=4)
```

Can investigate a bit futher by for example ploting only those with a median salary of more than $60k
```python
top_medians = df[df["Median"] > 60000].sort_values("Median")
top_medians.plot(x="Major", y=["P25th", "Median", "P75th"], kind="bar")
```

Outliers interesting as can point out invalid data

## Check for Correlation = scatter plot
```python
df.plot(x="Median", y="Unemployment_rate", kind="scatter")
```

For an overview of the correlations between different columns, you can use ".corr()"

## Analysing caterogies/groupings
To process bigger chunks of information, the human mind consciously and unconsciously sorts data into categories. This technique is often useful, but itâ€™s far from flawless.

In this case lets draw a horizontal bar to represent totals
```python
cat_totals = df.groupby("Major_category")["Total"].sum().sort_values()
cat_totals
cat_totals.plot(kind="barh", fontsize=4)
```

## Pie chart
Here we draw a pie chart from that data. But even better we group together the smaller categories
```python
small_cat_totals = cat_totals[cat_totals < 100_000]
big_cat_totals = cat_totals[cat_totals > 100_000]

# Adding a new item "Other" with the sum of the small categories
small_sums = pd.Series([small_cat_totals.sum()], index=["Other"])
big_cat_totals = big_cat_totals.append(small_sums)
big_cat_totals.plot(kind="pie", label="")
```

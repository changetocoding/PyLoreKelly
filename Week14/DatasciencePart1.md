*Data Science*: Extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. (Uses Machine Learning below)
*Machine learning*: Uses statistical learning algorithms to build systems that have the ability to automatically learn and improve from experiences without being explicitly programmed. They normally train on a data set to make predictions or take actions. This is a subset of AI


# Process:
Questions we want to explore/ask
We gather data & clean it
We analyse the data
We communicate the results of analysis
Rinse and repeat
